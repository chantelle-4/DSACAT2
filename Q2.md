a)Memory allocation- For arrays they are stored in one continuous block of memory while Linked lists store data in separate memory locations connected with pointers.

b)Performance- For arrays they are faster at accessing because you can jump to any element directly while Linked lists are slower at accessing because you must go through each element one by one.

c)Insertion and Deletion- For arrays if you insert or delete an element in the middle you have to move all the other elements to keep order which means shifting is required while Linked lists you can only change pointers and no shifting is required.
